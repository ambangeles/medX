The problem today with our own medical records is that they are fragmented which means we have medical records in every hospital we visit which can cause redundancies. Our medical records is not owned by ourselves, instead it resides in the system of every healthcare providers separately. That is why we created an integrated web application index of electronic health record using blockchain technology in order for one individual to have sense of ownership to its own medical records and to resolves aformentioned problems.
